# Automated YouTube Video Creator

Automated-YouTube-Video-Creator is a Python script that streamlines the process of generating YouTube video scripts, recording the screen, and uploading the video to YouTube. This project leverages various Python libraries and APIs to automate the creation of engaging video content.

## Features

- **YouTube API Integration:** Interacts with the YouTube API to retrieve previous video details and upload video information.
  
- **Gemini Integration:** Utilizes the Google Generative AI library (Gemini) to generate video scripts based on prompts provided to ChatGPT.

- **Screen Recording:** Implements a screen recording feature to capture the visual content for the generated video.

- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts text-based explanations into speech using the pyttsx3 library.

- **Thumbnail Generation:** Generates video thumbnails using the PIL library and FFmpeg.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine.
- API keys for YouTube and Gemini (Google Generative AI).
